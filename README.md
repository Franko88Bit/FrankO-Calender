My project repo is called FrankO-Calender and under this folder I have an assets folder, index.html and script.js and the README.md(this file) on the same level. Under the assets folder, I have 2 more sub folders called css and images and under the css folder, style.css is in there. Inside the images folder, there is 1 picture file for the example calendar app.
